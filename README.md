# Heart Failure Prediction


Visualizations are useful tools when it comes to making predictions. In this example we use them to better predict heart failures: all you need to do is to run [visualizations.ipynb](https://github.com/Rodrigo663/heart-failure-prediction/blob/main/visualizations.ipynb) and every figure is saved on the [figures directory](https://github.com/Rodrigo663/heart-failure-prediction/tree/main/figures). The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) used in this project was collected from real patients. 


## How does cholesterol affects the probability of a heart failure?

- 65% of heart failure patients had a cholesterol higher than recommended (200 mm/dl).
- The mean serum cholesterol is of 199 mm/dl.

## Does the cholesterol levels affect the Maximum Heart Rate?

**As seen bellow it doesnÂ´t!**
